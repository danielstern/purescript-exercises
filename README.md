# About

This project contains 2 PureScript / JavaScript hybrid projects.

Both projects are designed to 
- teach useful PureScript techniques
- show interoperability between PURS and JS
- act as boilerplates for a myriad of other project types

## Instructions
To run any demo, open the terminal to that demos folder, (run npm install,) and run the following scripts simulataneously.
- npm run watch:purs (creates purescript output file, watches for changes)
- npm run watch:js (watches app.js and output purescript files, build browser package with webpack)
- npm start (opens the browser and runs the app which implements PureScript)
